# SVDD

This SVDD (Support Vector Data Description) system is forked from Deep-SVDD-PyTorch (https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch).

## Setting up the Environment

1. @@@

```
pip
```

2. @@@

```
pip
```

3. @@@

```
pip
```

4. Since this training system requires data in the .npz format, we first convert the desired training CSV files (from the MOS system) into .npz format. Change the target files "file_paths" in csv_to_npz.py.

```
python csv_to_npz.py
```

5. @@@

```
mkdir log
mkdir scores
```
